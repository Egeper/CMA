A C program is always made up of functions and variables
    functions contain the statments that spectify the computing operations to be done.
        statements of a function are contained in braces({})
    variables store the values during the operations.
        all variables must be declared before they are used


Perameters are the required and the Arguments are the values that you put in them
    A function that expects no arguments are () indicated by an empty list
    Ex. //This is a prototype which has the perameters
        void lol(int suck, int you);

        //This is the function call with actual arguments
        lol(hi, boy);

A bunch of Characters enclosed in quotation marks("") are called character strings or string constant
    "Hello, My Boy"

In C integer division is truncated which removes the fractional part and 5/9 would be 0

Text input or output, regardless of where it originiates or hwere it goes to, is dealt wiht as streams of characters.
    A text stream is a sequence of characters divided into lines;
    each line consists of zero or more characters followed by a newline character

extern declaration is needed if a variable is using an external variable in other header files





Things to check
    semicolon
    if statement 1 = sign
    variables not set to 0
    loop stopping before or after intended index
    

before starting a program
	understand the question
	think of all possibilities
	think of all the bugs
	make a semi code thing
	write the code
	debug

Linux Coding Style
	indentation is 8 
	max column length is 80
	if (blah) {

	} else{

	}

	int function
	{

	}

	functions should really be short and sweet
	number of local variables should not exceed 5-10 or you're doing something wrong


	comments should tell what your code does not how
