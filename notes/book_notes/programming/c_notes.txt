General
	A C program is always made up of functions and variables
    	functions contain the statments that spectify the computing operations to be done.
        statements of a function are contained in braces({})
    	variables store the values during the operations.
        all variables must be declared before they are used

Terminology
	Perameters are the required and the Arguments are the values that you put in them
	A bunch of Characters enclosed in quotation marks("") are called character strings or string constant

Properties
	In C integer division is truncated which removes the fractional part and 5/9 would be 0
	Text input or output, regardless of where it originiates or hwere it goes to, is dealt wiht as streams of characters.
	A text stream is a sequence of characters divided into lines;
	each line consists of zero or more characters followed by a newline character

Special Syntax
	'extern x' declaration is needed if a variable is using an external variable in other header files

Common Errors
	semicolon
    	if statement 1 = sign
    	variables not set to 0
    	loop stopping before or after intended index
    	a requirement of something is not yet declared before it

Words of Advice
	functions should really be short and sweet
	number of local variables should not exceed 5-10 or you're doing something wrong
	comments should tell what your code does, not how
